Welcome to my personal website! I am a Ph.D. student specializing in computational material science, with a particular focus on the fields of molecular dynamics, topological data analysis, and machine learning.

My research interests lie at the intersection of these three areas, where I explore the fundamental physics and chemistry underlying the behavior of materials. Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations, I investigate how materials behave under different conditions and how they respond to external stimuli.

In addition to my work with molecular dynamics, I also incorporate topological data analysis techniques to better understand the complex structures and dynamics of materials. Furthermore, I utilize machine learning algorithms to develop models that can accurately predict material properties and behavior.

On this website, you can find information about my research projects, publications, and conference presentations. Please feel free to explore and reach out to me with any questions or collaboration opportunities.
