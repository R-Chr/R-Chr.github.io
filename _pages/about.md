<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I specialize in computational material science, with a particular focus on the fields of disordered materials, atomic simulations, and machine learning. My research interests lie at the intersection of these areas, where I explore the fundamental physics and chemistry underlying the behavior of materials through atomistic simulations, gaining a deeper understanding of these relations through the use of different data science methods.

Previous Ph.D. Fellow in the Glass Structure and Mechanics Group at Aalborg University, Department of Chemistry and Bioscience co-supervised by Morten M. Smedskjær and Lisbeth Fajstrup. 

On this website, you can find information about my research projects, publications, and conference presentations. Please feel free to explore and reach out to me with any questions or collaboration opportunities.

[Accelerating the Discovery of High-Conductivity Glass Electrolytes via Machine Learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/686fa7a443bc52e4ec366d6c)

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=UqBYL00AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=UqBYL00AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='UqBYL00AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC'></span></strong>
- A machine learning interatomic potential is introduced for rapid prediction of sodium-ion conductivity in a wide range of glass electrolytes across 1,303 compositions. The study demonstrates how anion chemistry, particularly sulphides and halides, governs ion mobility, and identifies structural descriptors linked to ionic conductivity. The findings offer a data-driven approach to designing high-performance glassy solid electrolytes for batteries.
